# TailorAI - Smart Job Application Helper

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [repository-url]
    cd tailorai-extension
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup (Python):**

    *   Create a virtual environment:

        ```bash
        cd backend
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
        ```

    *   Install dependencies:

        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

    *   Set up your Gemini API key:

        *   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory.
        *   Add your API key:

            ```
            GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
            ```

3.  **Run the Backend:**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    The backend will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

4.  **Chrome Extension Setup:**

    *   Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`.
    *   Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
    *   Click "Load unpacked" and select the `chrome-extension` directory.

## Gemini API Setup

1.  **Get an API Key:**

    *   Go to the [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) to obtain an API key.
    *   Make sure to enable the Gemini API for your project.

2.  **Set the API Key:**

    *   As mentioned in the Backend Setup, store your API key in the `.env` file.

## Sample Files for Testing

*   You can place sample resume and job description files in the `backend` directory for testing purposes.  Adjust the file paths in the `app.py` and `popup.js` files accordingly if you want to load them by default.

## UI Design Notes

*   The UI is designed with a card-based layout.
*   A dark mode toggle can be added in the `popup.html` and `popup.css` files.
*   Feedback buttons (üëç / üëé) can be added to the generated content section.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Gemini API Key Issues:** Ensure your Gemini API key is correctly set in the `.env` file.
*   **Backend Not Running:** Make sure the Flask backend is running before using the extension.
*   **Extension Not Loading:** Double-check that you have loaded the extension correctly in Chrome's developer mode.
*   **CORS Errors:** If you encounter CORS errors, ensure that the Flask backend is configured to allow cross-origin requests (CORS is enabled).
